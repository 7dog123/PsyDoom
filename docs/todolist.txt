- Add output scaling options (1:1, NTSC stretch, integer multiples, stretch to fit etc.)
- Make file overrides (basic mod system) work on MacOS
- Automap: fix lines being clipped 1 pixel short
- Do an error message on failure to connect in multiplayer games explaining the issue.
- Implement prefs saving/loading
    - Save passwords for the current map and restore on launch.
    - Save sound/music prefs
    - Provide an in-game menu to adjust turn sensitivity
- Fix up view bobbing inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix up gravity inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix separate movement directions (left/right) not cancelling each other out.
    - This behavior might have to be otherwise preserved though for demo compatibility.
- Add 'dev mode' setting and gate the pause convenience cheats behind that.
- Make CD audio use the new disc reader and not the emulator CD-ROM.
    - Thread safe and should also work with multi bin .cue.
- Investigate moving sound processing onto another thread and triggered in demand to output buffer requirements.
    - Should fix all stuttering, and free up main thread resources.
- Try to fix Avocado occasional flickering/twitching pixels with rasterizer.
    - Need to run at capped framerate to see properly.
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.
- Make GPU primitives go more directly to the rasterizer rather than through a buffer.
- Implement PC style cheat codes for convenience (IDDQD, IDFKA etc.).
- Break the link between the SPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Break the link between the GPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Implement playing the intro movies and legal text
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.
- Investigate a possible 'high res' or crispy mode.
    - May need an extended framebuffer for this
    - May be more feasible in a completely rewritten renderer
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
    - No texture cache overflow
    - Expanded VRAM
    - Expanded SRAM
    - Greatly enlargened heap
    - Remove temporary buffer limits
    - Remove geometry clipping limits where possible
- Investigate the possibility of dithering to improve rendering output.
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
    - Could also be used for a rewind feature??!
    - Could also be used for a save feature.
- Linux support.
- Verify NTSC stretched resolution is fully correct.
- Allow wall heights > 256 units; make adjustments to the renderer to split up overly tall wall columns.
- Maybe get rid of use of the 'scratchpad' and use globals or locals (where possible) for LIBGPU primitives.
- Support a clean exit from the game everywhere (except I_Error)
- Replace I_Error with an error dialog?
    - More friendly in modern environments.
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.    
- Investigate shutdown code and properly cleanup everything
- Move reversing tools into their own folder and only include optionally in the cmake project.
    - Shouldn't be needed to compile the game.
- Fix bug in cmd queue stuff - occasional geometry weirdness.
    - Not triggered in practice? Might be just a theoretical bug.
- Investigate rendering glitch when above a sprite sometimes (appears enlargened on screen)
    - May need tools to help with this
- Do a final pass to revert any Avocado mods which are no longer needed.
- Do a final review/diff against PSXDOOM-RE to double check for any inconsistencies.
- Writeup final readmes and docs.
