- Fixup networking code for analog movements.
- Add mouse support & mouse sensitivity setting.
- Add 'dev mode' setting and gate the pause convenience cheats behind that.
- Fix up view bobbing inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix up gravity inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix separate movement directions (left/right) not cancelling each other out.
- Add output scaling options (1:1, NTSC stretch, integer multiples, stretch to fit etc.)
- Incorporate lost soul spawn limit fix but make configurable and off by default.
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.
- Implement a .cue parser seperate to Avocado with working multi-track support.
- Implement a class that can read directly from the CD-ROM image without using the emulator cdrom.
    - Allow both audio and data to be read.
    - Thread safe with multiple instances and works independently.
- Implement reading the ISO filesystem on the CD and providing info on where files are located.
- Replace hardcoded file offsets with ISO filesystem results.
- Make all file I/O bypass LIBCD and the emulated cdrom.
    - Free the cd-rom for just audio use, and potentially safely running on another thread.
    - Remove low level LIBCD stuff that will no longer be needed.
- Final Doom support!
- Investigate moving sound processing onto another thread and triggered in demand to output buffer requirements.
    - Should fix all stuttering, and free up main thread resources.
- Allow turning outside of the 30 FPS cap to improve responsiveness.
    - Can get rid of interpolations for view rotations.
- Try to fix Avocado occasional flickering/twitching pixels with rasterizer.
    - Need to run at capped framerate to see properly.
- Fix bug in cmd queue stuff - occasional geometry weirdness.
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.
- Make GPU primitives go more directly to the rasterizer rather than through a buffer.
- Implement fully bindable/configurable controls.
- Implement PC style cheat codes for convenience (IDDQD, IDFKA etc.).
- Investigate why PAL demos are breaking.
    - Might need a completely new set of state_t etc. with different timings.    
- Break the link between the SPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Break the link between the GPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.
- Investigate a possible 'high res' or crispy mode.
    - May need an extended framebuffer for this
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
- Investigate expanding or removing VRAM limit
- Investigate the possibility of dithering to improve rendering output.
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate and fix issues with network play and uncapped framerates.
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
- Do a final pass to revert any Avocado mods which are no longer needed.
- Do a final pass to optimize #includes.
