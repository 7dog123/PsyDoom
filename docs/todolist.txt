0.5.0:
- Make PAL mode tick at 50 Hz
- Verify demo compatibility with PAL Doom
    - Record a full playthrough and verify OK
- Verify demo compatibility with Final Doom
    - Record a full playthrough and verify OK
    - Verify with mouse and controller
    - Verify PAL and NTSC
- Fix Redemption Denied animated floor bug
    - Only enable the animation for Final Doom
    - Check other animations added in case they conflict too
- Double sound buffer size (or more?)
- Is there a bug with the game not switching to the chaingun (if you have it) when out of shotgun ammo?    
- Incorporate lost soul spawn limit fix
    - For Doom make configurable and off by default (20 skulls was the intended limit).
    - For Final Doom it was fixed and should NOT be configurable - 16 skulls is the limit (see Final Doom diffs)
- Incorporate game type into network packet ids (Doom vs Final Doom, NTSC-U, NTSC-J, PAL)
- Incorporate network protocol version into multiplayer game setup packet.
- Fix the small gaps at the side of the screen during screen fades.

Future:
- Allow playing the game in PAL mode.
- Add the official game demos to the automated test suites.
- Make all changes affecting demo compatibility configurable.
- Synchronize game settings in multiplayer affecting demo compatibility.
    - Also force the correct settings for original demo playback.
- Do an error message on failure to connect in multiplayer games explaining the issue.
- Fix up view bobbing inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix up gravity inconsistency (15 vs 30 Hz)
- Fix separate movement directions (left/right) not cancelling each other out.
    - This behavior might have to be otherwise preserved though for demo compatibility.
- Add output scaling options (1:1, NTSC stretch, integer multiples, stretch to fit etc.)
- Add 'dev mode' setting and gate the pause convenience cheats behind that.
- Incorporate the player missile damage fix and make it an optional setting (off by default)
- Add demo recording support and a new demo format that supports 30 FPS recording and analog movement.
    - Still support old format for playback, add signature to demo start to identify.
- Make CD audio use the new disc reader and not the emulator CD-ROM.
    - Thread safe and should also work with multi bin .cue.
- Investigate moving sound processing onto another thread and triggered in demand to output buffer requirements.
    - Should fix all stuttering, and free up main thread resources.
- Try to fix Avocado occasional flickering/twitching pixels with rasterizer.
    - Need to run at capped framerate to see properly.
- Investigate interpolation for sprites and sectors in addition to player view.
- Make GPU primitives go more directly to the rasterizer rather than through a buffer.
- Implement fully bindable/configurable controls.
- Implement PC style cheat codes for convenience (IDDQD, IDFKA etc.).
- Break the link between the SPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Break the link between the GPU and Avocado 'system' (entire PSX)
- Implement playing the intro movies and legal text
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via map wads.
- Investigate being able to add override/new lumps via custom user wads.
- Investigate a possible 'high res' or crispy mode.
    - May need an extended framebuffer for this
    - May be more feasible in a completely rewritten renderer
- Investigate engine limits and try to remove/expand where possible
    - No texture cache overflow
    - Expanded VRAM
    - Expanded SRAM
    - Greatly enlargened heap
    - Remove temporary buffer limits
    - Remove geometry clipping limits where possible
- Investigate the possibility of dithering to improve rendering output.
- Investigate a MAPINFO format for naming maps, choosing music etc.
- Investigate rollback networking to combat latency.
    - Could also be used for a rewind feature??!
    - Could also be used for a save feature.
- Linux support.
- Verify NTSC stretched resolution is fully correct.
- Allow wall heights > 256 units; make adjustments to the renderer to split up overly tall wall columns.
- Automap zoom/pan with mouse.
- Make file overrides (basic mod system) work on MacOS
- Maybe get rid of use of the 'scratchpad' and use globals or locals (where possible) for LIBGPU primitives.
- Support a clean exit from the game everywhere (except I_Error)
- Replace I_Error with an error dialog?
    - More friendly in modern environments.
- Investigate shutdown code and properly cleanup everything
- Move reversing tools into their own folder and only include optionally in the cmake project.
    - Shouldn't be needed to compile the game.
- Fix bug in cmd queue stuff - occasional geometry weirdness.
    - Not triggered in practice? Might be just a theoretical bug.
- Investigate rendering glitch when above a sprite sometimes (appears enlargened on screen)
    - May need tools to help with this
- Do a final pass to revert any Avocado mods which are no longer needed.
- Do a final review/diff against PSXDOOM-RE to double check for any inconsistencies.
- Writeup final readmes and docs.
- Do a final pass to optimize #includes.
