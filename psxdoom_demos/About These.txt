Demos recorded using the original PlayStation Doom (Greatest Hits edition) along with the expected end player state for each demo.
The demos were generated by applying a hack/patch to Avocado to coax the game to record demos upon entering a level and save them upon exiting.
The expected results are saved by PsyDoom after manually watching the demos and verifying they look OK.

Used for automated verification of PsyDoom, to verify game code changes do not result in different game behavior.
