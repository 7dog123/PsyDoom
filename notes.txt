The $gp register appears to be set to the following in main() and kept at that value:
    800775E0

Stack:
    - The end address ('00200000' or 2 MiB) is stored at '80077BF8'
    - The max stack size ('00008000' or 32 KiB) is stored at '80077BFC'
    - Therefore the minimium stack address (to hold a 64-bit value) is '1F7FF8'

Heap:
    - Initialized to a base address of '800A9EC4'
    - Size is set to '14E134' (1,368,372 bytes)
    - End of the heap is at '801F7FF8'

Zeroed globals memory region:
    - The loaded program ends at '80078000'.
    - The heap begins at '800A9EC4'.
    - Therefore there is a gap of '31EC4' (204,484 bytes)
    - Some globals appear to be stored in this region.
        - But they are not a part of the executable image itself.
    - main() appears to zero the memory for this area before initializing the heap and a little bit before that.

Sprite lumps in PSX DOOM which are NOT in the PC version:

Likely range of 'states' (array of 'state_t'):
    80058D8C-8005E03B (inclusive)
        756 states?

Likely start of 'mobjinfo_t' (array of 'mobjinfo_t'): 
    8005E03C (first entry appears to be the player)

To access an unused scrolling copyright notice, change the instruction at '80012334' from 'F9 48 00 0C' to 'E9 48 00 0C'. This appears to be similar to the copyright notice that is drawn by the initial 'SLUS_000.77' executable, but scrolling and with a shotgun sound played at the start. Was it used in the Demo verison perhaps?
