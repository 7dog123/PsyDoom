# About These
Demos recorded using the original PlayStation Doom and Final Doom (NTSC-U and PAL) along with the expected end player state for each demo, and also some original demos from the 4 game variants. New (non-original) game demos were generated by applying a hack/patch to the [Avocado PSX emulator](https://github.com/JaCzekanski/Avocado) to coax the game to record demos upon entering a level and save them upon exiting. The expected results are saved by PsyDoom after manually watching the demos and verifying that they look OK and that there is no de-sync.

These demos are used for the automated verification of PsyDoom, to verify that code changes do not result in it straying from the original PSX Doom behavior. Note that PsyDoom intentionally changes some game behavior in a non demo-compatible way outside of playing original demos, but all those instances of behavior changes are well documented and will eventually be configurable.
